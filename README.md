What is Handwritten Digit Recognition?
The handwritten digit recognition is the ability of computers to recognize human handwritten digits. It is a hard task for the machine because handwritten digits are not perfect and can be made with many different flavors. The handwritten digit recognition is the solution to this problem which uses the image of a digit and recognizes the digit present in the image.


In this article, we have successfully built a Python deep learning project on handwritten digit recognition app. We have built and trained the Convolutional neural network which is very effective for image classification purposes. Later on, we build the GUI where we draw a digit on the canvas then we classify the digit and show the results.
